# HW-Train-Scheduler

Welcome to the Train Scheduler App
Use this app to organize your train schedules.
A form is used to capture the details entered.
Firebase database is used to store the information entered and referenced to calculate next train arrival time.
Momentjs is used to calculate the next train time arrival time.

FUNCTIONALITY

Use the form on the bottom half of the page to enter in your:
    1. Train name
    2. Destination name
    3. Time of the first train of the day in 24 hr. format
    4. Frequency of the train in minutes (ex: every 15 mins)
    5. Click "Submit"

Upon clicking the "Submit" button, your the details entered in the form along with the Next Arrival time and Mins Away will display in the section labeled "Current Crazy Train Schedule"

I would like to add a flip board to a future version of the app.
